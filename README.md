# Operations Research Coursework Repository

This repository contains a collection of lab projects from the "Badania Operacyjne" course, completed during my second semester at university. It showcases the practical application of various optimization algorithms and problem-solving techniques in operations research.

## Highlights:
- Implementation of the **Simplex algorithm** for linear programming.
- Solutions to the **Critical Path Method** for project planning.
- Approaches to the **Assignment problem**, optimizing resource allocation.
- Exploration of different algorithms to tackle the **Knapsack problem**.

Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific lab task, complete with code, documentation, and results.
